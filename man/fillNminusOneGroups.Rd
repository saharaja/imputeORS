N-1 group completed data

\description{
Some of the occupational groups are only missing a single mean estimate.
E.g., binary occupational groups (with requirement levels 'YES'/'NO') that
have one estimate available can be filled in based on the known data.
Similarly, if an occupational group has 5 levels, and 4 of them have known
estimates, then the final one can be calculated. This is because the total
value of any occupational group must be 100\%.

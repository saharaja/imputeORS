\description{
Rather than simply running the models on the original data, we created
simulations for each record to generate 10 unique datasets, where each
(simulated) estimate was drawn from a beta distribution derived from the
original data (mean and error estimates). This allows for generating a family
of models and a distribution of imputed values for each missing estimate,
rather than a single point estimate. This distribution can be used to
calculate a confidence level for each imputed value.
